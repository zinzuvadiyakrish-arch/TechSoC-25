2. Problem Releases
New problem statements will be released Every 2 Weeks to keep the momentum going:

🎁 Bonus Levels: Advanced challenges for early finishers will be released for each Problem Statement.
3. Submit Your Solutions
Work in your 🍴 forked repository
Place solutions in the respective Problem_Statement_X/ folders
Include both your code and any documentation
Show your thought process - we love seeing how you approach problems! 🧠
4. Level Up Your Skills
Each completed problem statement builds your coding arsenal. By the end, you'll have the confidence and knowledge to tackle problem statements from any core or non-core club. 💯

📋 Evaluation & Progression System
How Progression Works
Sequential Unlock System: 📈

Complete Problem Statement 1 → Get evaluated → Unlock Problem Statement 2
Complete Problem Statement 2 → Get evaluated → Unlock Problem Statement 3
And so on...
Evaluation Process: 🔍

Submit your solution in your forked repository
Our team reviews your submission (code + documentation)
You receive confirmation via GitHub/email to proceed to the next problem
Next challenge unlocks and you continue your learning journey!
✅ What We Evaluate
Primary Criteria (Most Important):

Functioning code that solves the problem correctly
Clear understanding of the concepts involved
Genuine effort and problem-solving approach
Bonus Points (Nice to Have):

Good documentation explaining your thought process
Clean, readable code with proper comments
Additional test cases or edge case handling
Creative optimizations or alternative approaches
Our Philosophy
No Elimination Policy:

No fixed number of participants will be "cut" at each level
Everyone who submits functioning code can proceed
Even your best attempt with partial solutions is valued
Learning effort matters more than perfect solutions
Our Promise:

If you submit working code → ✅ Automatic progression
If you submit partial solution with clear effort → ✅ Very Likely progression
Success Mindset: 🎯

"This is about learning and growth, not elimination. So give it your best shot"
