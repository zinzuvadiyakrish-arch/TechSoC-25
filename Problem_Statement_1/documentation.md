What the problem is asking: The problem staement asks us to create a code which encodes or decodes any line of text without altering any special characters by shifting each alphabet 2 steps forward. Key concepts involved: This project involves use of control loops like if else , while as well as use of some special string functions.

My approach: I used the special string funactions like .at() [used to identify the index of the character in the statement], .length()[used to find the length of the string].I then used if else statements to handle general as well as boundary cases.
