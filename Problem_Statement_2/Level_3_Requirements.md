- computer_pokemon: Pokemon object
- difficulty: string ("easy", "medium", "hard")

Status effects:

- duration: integer (turns remaining)
```

## Output Format

## Example 1: AI Battle with Status Effects

### Input:
```python
# Create Pokemon with status-inducing moves
venomoth = Pokemon("Venomoth", 95, 65, 60, 90,
                  [("Poison Powder", 0, "poison"), ("Psychic", 55), ("Sleep Powder", 0, "sleep"), ("Bug Buzz", 50)])

alakazam = Pokemon("Alakazam", 85, 90, 45, 120,
                  [("Psychic", 55), ("Thunder Wave", 0, "paralysis"), ("Teleport", 0), ("Psybeam", 45)])

# Start AI battle (computer controls Alakazam)
ai_battle = AIBattle(venomoth, alakazam, difficulty="hard")
ai_battle.start_battle()
```

### Expected Output:

## AI Decision Logic
```
def choose_move(self, opponent):
    if self.hp < 30% and has_healing_move():
        return healing_move
    elif opponent.hp > 70% and has_status_move():
        return status_move  
    elif opponent.hp < 25%:
        return strongest_move
    else:
        return most_effective_move
```

## Status Effects System
```
Poison: Deals 10% max HP damage each turn for 4 turns
Paralysis: 50% chance to skip turn for 3 turns  
Sleep: Cannot move for 2-4 turns (random duration)
```

## Tournament Structure
